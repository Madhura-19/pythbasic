ABOUT:

Learning Python or getting introduced to the Computer Programming itself.
This Repo contains the most common and basic programs one needs to get started.

HOW TO USE:

Core codes are written as function in the "momoslibrary.py" and depending on which program you are developing
the "interface.py" can be modified to do the necessary while calling the relevant functions from the library.

Happy Learning!
