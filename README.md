ABOUT:

Learning Python or getting introduced to the Computer Programming itself.
This Repo contains the most common and basic programs one needs to get started.

HOW TO USE:

Core codes are written as function in the "momoslibrary.py" and depending on which program you are developing
the "interface.py" can be modified to do the necessary while calling the relevant functions from the library.

ALSO:

separate folders are created for separate set of programs for more organised look.

To Start with some programs try these:

1) Write a program to accept five numbers and display the sum of the numbers.
2) Write a program to two numbers and check if the first is divisible by second.
3) Write a program to accept three numbers and display highest and lowest number.
4) Write a program to generate the first 10 odd numbers and display the average of these
numbers.
5) Write a program to generate the Fibonacci series. The first two numbers should be o and 1 and
last 89. ( 0,1,2,3,5,8,13,………,89).
6) Write a program to print the product of the first 10 even numbers ( 2*4*6*……..*20) using loop.
7) Write a program to accept the n th term and find out sum of first n th 
8) Write a program to accept the n th term and find out sum of square of first n th term.


Happy Learning!!!
