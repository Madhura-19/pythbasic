ABOUT:

Learning Python or getting introduced to the Computer Programming itself.
This Repo contains the most common and basic programs one needs to get started.



GETTING STARTED:

1)Create a file by your name with .py extension.

2)Refer to the file AyodhyaPrasadProblems.txt

3)There are 50 programming problems in there, write the program asked in them and push the code for consideration.

4)Your programs will be verified then added as a function to your corresponding python library file.

5)Try to include this in your daily habit. one problem a day.

Tip: Try to allocate time with something you already do routinely, like associating it with breakfast or gym or newspaper reading this will help you adopt programming into your regular habit.

Happy Learning!!!
